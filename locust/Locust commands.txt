LOCUST COMMANDS.
===============

Locust is a popular open-source load testing tool that allows users to simulate the behavior of multiple users accessing a web application simultaneously. Here are some commonly used commands in Locust:

1.Starting the Locust Master: To start a Locust master node, use the following command:

	locust -f /path/to/your/script.py --master
	Replace /path/to/your/script.py with the path to your Locust script file. The --master flag specifies that this is a master node.

2.Starting the Locust Worker: To start a Locust worker node, use the following command:

	locust -f /path/to/your/script.py --worker --master-host=MASTER_HOST_IP_ADDRESS
	Replace /path/to/your/script.py with the path to your Locust script file and MASTER_HOST_IP_ADDRESS with the IP address of the machine running the master node. The --worker flag specifies that this is a worker node and the --master-host flag specifies the IP address of the master node.

3.Starting the Locust Web Interface: To start the Locust web interface, use the following command:

	locust -f /path/to/your/script.py
	Replace /path/to/your/script.py with the path to your Locust script file. This command will start the Locust web interface on the default port 8089.

4.Headless Mode and only summary: To run Locust in headless mode, use the following command:

	locust -f /path/to/your/script.py --headless --only summary
	This command will run Locust without starting the web interface.

5.Setting the Number of Users: You can set the number of users using the following command:

	locust -f /path/to/your/script.py --headless -u NUM_USERS
	Replace /path/to/your/script.py with the path to your Locust script file and NUM_USERS with the number of users you want to simulate.

6.Setting the Hatch Rate: You can set the hatch rate using the following command:

	locust -f /path/to/your/script.py --headless -r HATCH_RATE
	Replace /path/to/your/script.py with the path to your Locust script file and HATCH_RATE with the number of users you want to simulate per second.

7.Specifying the Test Duration: You can specify the test duration using the following command:

	locust -f /path/to/your/script.py --headless -t TEST_DURATION
	Replace /path/to/your/script.py with the path to your Locust script file and TEST_DURATION with the duration of the test in seconds.
	
8.--logfile: This option allows you to specify the path to the log file that Locust should write its logs to. For example:

	locust --logfile=/path/to/logfile.log

9.--loglevel: This option allows you to specify the log level that Locust should use. The available log levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, and ERROR. For example:

	locust --loglevel=INFO
	locust --logfile=/path/to/mylogfile.log --loglevel=INFO
	locust --logfile=<path to log file> --loglevel=<log level>

	To use both options together, you can simply include both command-line options when starting Locust:
	locust --logfile=/path/to/logfile.log --loglevel=INFO
	This will start Locust with logging enabled and will write log messages to the specified log file at the specified log level.



These are some commonly used commands in Locust.
