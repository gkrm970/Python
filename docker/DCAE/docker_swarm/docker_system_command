docker info: Provides detailed information about the Docker installation, such as the number of containers and images, storage driver used, and system resources.


docker images: Lists all the Docker images available on the system.


docker ps: Displays the running containers on the system.


docker logs: Fetches the logs of a specific container.


docker stats: Shows live resource usage statistics for all running containers.


docker exec: Runs a command in a running container.


docker build: Builds a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
