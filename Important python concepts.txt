Important python concepts
============================

1. ast.literal_eval() or a JSON parser.
	The statement normal_list = eval(payload_fedkafkabus_id) means that the Python eval() function is being used to evaluate the contents of the variable payload_fedkafkabus_id as a Python expression, and the result is being assigned to the variable normal_list.
	Assuming that payload_fedkafkabus_id is a string containing a valid Python expression, the eval() function will parse and execute the expression, returning the result. In this case, the result will be a Python list object, which will be assigned to normal_list.
	However, it's important to note that using eval() to evaluate arbitrary strings can be dangerous, as it can execute potentially malicious code. 
	If payload_fedkafkabus_id is not trusted or properly sanitized, it could be used to execute arbitrary code on the system running the program. Therefore, 
	it's generally recommended to avoid using eval() with untrusted input, and instead use safer alternatives like ast.literal_eval() or a JSON parser if appropriate.
