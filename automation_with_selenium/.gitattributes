# Each line in the .gitattributes file is a pattern followed by an attributes     #
# list, separated by whitespaces.                                                 #
#                                                                                 #

#   text    This attribute enables and controls end-of-line normalization.        #
#           When a text file is normalized, its line endings are converted        #
#           to LF in the *repository*.                                            #
#                                                                                 #
#           When text is set to "auto", the path is marked for automatic          #
#           end-of-line conversion. If Git decides that the content is text,      #
#           its line endings are converted to LF on checkin. When the file has    #
#           been committed with CRLF, no conversion is done.                      #
#                                                                                 #
#   eol     This attribute sets a specific line-ending style to be used in        #
#           the *working directory*.                                              #
#                                                                                 #
#           Setting the attribute to string value "lf" forces Git to              #
#           normalize line endings to LF on checkin and prevents conversion       #
#           to CRLF when the file is checked out.                                 #

# The entire git repository only contains Linux-style line endings in text files
