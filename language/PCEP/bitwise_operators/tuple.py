What is the output of the following snippet:

a = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
a = a[::-1]
print(a)

(50, 40, 30, 20, 10)
This line reverses the elements in the tuple a. It uses a slicing technique with a step of -1. Slicing extracts a portion of a sequence based on starting, stopping, and step indices within square brackets [].

Write a Python program to create an empty tuple:

x=()
0r x = tuple()

Not the following
x= (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
x = (0)
x = tuple(3)


Write a Python program to create an empty list:

x=[]

Not the following

x = list(0)
x = list(3)
x = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

What is the output of the following snippet:

x = tuple(3)
print(x)

TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable

Write a Python program to create a tuple with different data types:

print(x)

("a", "b", 1.1, 2,True, "c")

Access value 30 from the following tuple:

a = (10, [20, 30], 40, 50)

a[1][1]

Which of the following is used to create a tuple called tuple1 which contains numbers from 1 to 5?

tuple1 = (1,2,3,4,5)
tuple2 = 1,2,3,4,5

Access value 30 from the following tuple:

a = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)

a[2]

What is the output of the following command if the tuple1 has values (0,1,2,3,4,5) :

print(tuple1[0:4])
(0, 1, 2, 3)

What is the output of the following command if the tuple1 has values (1,2,3,4,5) :

print(tuple1.append(6))
