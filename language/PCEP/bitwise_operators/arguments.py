"""
Define a function that gets the user input and add to it a number we passed to the function.

Sample input:  6
Sample output:
print( add_num(5) )
11

def add_num(num):
    return int(input()) + num

add_num(5)

The output of the following snippet of the code will be:

def print_name_age(name, age=19):
    print(name, age)

print_name_age('john', 18)

The output of the following snippet of the code will be:

a = 0
def add_three(a):
	return a+3

result = add_three(3)
print(result)

6 ---> Recent value would be considered

Regarding the definition of the function and the sample input, Choose the correct value of the output.

Function :  def add_func(num1,num2):
                   	return num1 + num2

Sample input: print ( add_func(5 , num1= 10) )

error

What is the output of the following snippet:

def my_function(*friends):
  print("The tallest student is " + friends[0])

my_function("john", "Ella", "mark")

The tallest student is john

The output of the following snippet of the code will be:

nums= [7,4,1]
def change_third_item(list):
	list[2] = 5

change_third_item(nums)
print(nums)

[7, 4, 5] ---> what ever the name of the argument provided to the function that should exist and data type should be same as provided in the function parameter

What will be the result of calling the fullname_func function with the argument 'John'?

def fullname_func(fname):
  print(fname + " Mark")

fullname_func("John")

John Mark

What will be the result of calling the fullname_func function with the arguments 'John' and 'Mark'?

def fullname_func(fname, lname):
  print(fname + " " + lname)

fullname_func("John", "Mark")

John Mark
