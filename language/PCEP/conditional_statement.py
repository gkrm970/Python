Which one of the following if statements will not execute successfully ?

# 1st if statement
if True: print('hello')

# 2nd if statement
if (5,10):
print('hello')

# 3rd if statement
if (yes):
  print('hello')

# 4th if statement
if (5,10): print('hello')

3rd if statement
2nd if statement
2nd statement: IndentationError: expected an indented block, 3rd statement: NameError: name 'yes' is not defined.

NOTE: The condition in if statement is (5,10), which is a tuple containing the values 5 and 10. In Python, non-empty containers like tuples are considered "truthy," meaning they are treated as true in a boolean context.

Given the nested if-else below, what will be the value x when the code executed successfully.

x = 0
a = 6
b = 6
if a > 0:
    if b < 0:
        x = x + 6
    elif a > 6:
        x = x + 5
    else:
        x = x + 4
else:
    x = x + 3

print(x)

Which statement will check if a is equal to b?

if a == b:
if (a == b):

What is the output of the following python code?

a = 5
b = 10
if b > a:
print("b is greater than a")

IndentationError: expected an indented block, b is greater than a: SyntaxError: invalid syntax

What keyword would you use to add an alternative condition to an if statement?

elif

What is the output of the following python code?

a = 5
b = 10
if b < a:
  print("a is greater than b")
elif a == b:
  b = 5
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("b is greater than a")

b is greater than a

What does the following Python program display?

x = 3
if ( x == 0 ):
  print("Am I here?")
elif ( x == 3 ):
  print("Or here?")
print("Or over here?")

or here?
or over here?

What is the output of the following python code?

x = -10
if x < 0:
    print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
print("This is always printed")

The negative number  -10  is not valid here.
this is always printed

Which of the following is not a boolean expression?

3+4  this not a boolean expression
true
3==4
3+4 =7
