# 1. what is acceptance testing?

#     Acceptance testing is a crucial phase in software development where a system is thoroughly evaluated to determine
#     its compliance with business requirements. The primary goal of acceptance testing is to assess whether the system
#     is acceptable for delivery or not.
# Tpes of acceptance testing
#     UAT -> user acceptance testing -> maily look at it.
#     BAT -> business acceptance testing
#     RAT -> regulatory acceptance testing
#     CAT --> contract acceptance testing
#     SAT -> service acceptance testing

# 2 what is need of acceptance testing?
#     Acceptance testing is crucial in the software development process for several reasons:

#     Reduced Risk of Release Issues: - Acceptance testing helps to reduce the risk of release issues.
#     Improved User Experience: - Acceptance testing helps to improve the user experience.
#     Alignment with Business Goals: - Acceptance testing helps to align with business goals.
#     Improved Productivity: - Acceptance testing helps to improve the productivity.
#     Early Feedback and Course Correction: - Acceptance testing helps to early feedback and course correction.
#     Reduced Development Costs: - Acceptance testing helps to reduce the development costs.

# 3. what is acceptance test driven development ATDD? Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) is a software
# development methodology that emphasizes collaboration and communication between different project stakeholders. It
# focuses on writing acceptance tests before actually coding the functionality.
#
# Collaboration: ATDD is often referred
# to as the "Three Amigos" approach, highlighting the importance of collaboration between the customer (representing
# business needs), developer (understanding technical feasibility), and tester (ensuring testability).
#     ATDD shares some similarities with other approaches like:
#
    # Test-Driven Development (TDD): Both write tests before code, but ATDD focuses on user-centric acceptance tests,
    # whereas TDD deals with lower-level unit tests.
    # Behavior-Driven Development (BDD): Both emphasize user stories and
    # scenarios, but ATDD has a stronger focus on formal acceptance tests as a deliverable.



# 4. Can we say that one robotframe is enough for testing python programming language? what is robot framework?
    # No, Robot Framework alone is not sufficient for comprehensively testing Python programs. Here's why:
    #
    # Focus: Robot Framework is a generic keyword-driven testing framework, not specifically designed for Python.
#   It excels at acceptance testing, where tests are written from a user's perspective using high-level keywords.
    #Acceptance Testing: It's great for testing web applications, APIs, and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) built with Python frameworks like Django or Flask.

    # Flexibility:  Robot Framework's power lies in its extensibility. You can create custom keywords using Python libraries like unittest or selenium to target specific Python functionalities


# 5. how can we do a test python framework using a robot framework?
# Robot Framework is a powerful tool for acceptance
# testing Python frameworks, but it can't handle everything on its own. Here's a breakdown of how to leverage Robot
# Framework for testing Python frameworks effectively:

# Define Acceptance Criteria
# Write Robot Framework Tests:
# Utilize Built-in Keywords:
# Create Custom Keywords with Python Libraries

# 6. what is the website/YouTube chanel/blog you use for python development?
# Blog.python.org

# 7 what is RIDE? How you create a project in ride? How to write and execute test cases? Explain setup and tear down.

# 8 Explain report and logs
# how you do keyword driven, behavior-driven and data driver test cases?
    # All three approaches (keyword-driven, behavior-driven, and data-driven) aim to improve the way we write test cases,
    # but they focus on different aspects

    #1. Keyword-Driven Testing (KDT): Keyword-driven testing is when we write test cases using keywords.
    # Focus: Keywords represent actions within the application. Tests are written as a sequence of these keywords.

# . Behavior-Driven Development (BDD): BDD is when we write test cases using behavior.
    # Focus: Test cases are written in natural language, describing expected system behavior from the user's perspective.

# 3. Data-Driven Testing (DDT)
    # Focus: Tests are designed to run with multiple sets of data to ensure the application works consistently under various conditions.

# How you do dropdown testing?
# How you do text box testing?
# How do you work with a browser using a selenium library?
# How do you work with Excel using an openpyxl library?
#     for data driven testing,
# What is agile?
# Explain agile methodology?
# How is bug reported and solved ?
# do you have knowledge on selenium /api testing
# how do you work with JSON
# According to you what is the best tool to test API automation? And how
# you have been given a junior fellow for your project. It's your responsibility to handle him/her. How do you handle ?
# how you guide them ? what kind of knowledge you gave to them?
