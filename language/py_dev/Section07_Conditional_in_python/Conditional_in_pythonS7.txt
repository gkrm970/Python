Lecture: If conditional statement:

age = input('Enter your age')
age = int(age)
 
if age>=18:
    print('You are an adult')
else:
    print('You are not an adult')

Lecture: Nested IF

Explain the below example in detail:

age = int(input('Enter your age'))
if age>=18:
    score = int(input('Enter your exam score'))
    if score>=40:
        print('You meet both the age and score criteria and are qualified for the post')
    else:
        print('You meet the age criteria but not the score criteria, disqualified')
else:
    print('You do not meet the age criteria, try when you are above 18 ')


Lecture: Range function



numbers =[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]


Using range

numbers =list(range(10))
print(numbers)


List of numbers from 1-9

numbers =list(range(1,10))


List of numbers from 1 to 10

numbers =list(range(1,11))


List of 100 numbers

numbers =list(range(1,101))
print(numbers)


Range function takes two parameters

range(start,stop)


Additional parameter called as step

range(start,stop,step)


Using step.

range(1,101,3)


Lecture: For loop



for x in range(1,10):
    print (x)


for x in range(1,10):
    print (x)


Lecture: Iterating list of items

Loop through a list of items

fruits = ['apple','mango','banana','orange']
 
for x in fruits:
    print(x)


Lecture: Iterating a dictionary

people={"John":32,"Rob":40,"Tim":20}
 
# To get access to keys
for x in people:
    print(x)
 
#To get access to values
for x in people:
    print(people[x])


Lecture: While loop



counter = 0
 
while counter<=10:
    print(counter)
    counter = counter + 1


Lecture: Break



counter = 0
 
while counter<=10:
 
    counter = counter + 1
    if counter == 5:
        break
    print(counter)
# The below line will be executed Because break stops the loop from executing,
#not the entire program
print('Line after break')


Lecture: Continue

counter = 0
 
while counter<=10:
 
    counter = counter + 1
    if counter == 5:
        continue
    print(counter)
print('Line after continue')


Lecture: Adding items to cart using loop

# Let's say we want to create a shopping cart
cart = []
 
# Accept the number of items we want
n = int(input("Enter the number of items: "))
 
for x in range(n):
    item = input("Enter the item to add to the cart: ")
    cart.append(item)
    print(cart)
 
# This code now accepts multiple items and adds them to the cart.
