 code snippet that uses the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library in Python to convert text to audio:
 
 from gtts import gTTS
import os

def text_to_speech(text, filename):
    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save(filename)

    # Play the audio file
    os.system(f"mpg123 {filename}")  # You may need to install mpg123 or change the command based on your system

# Example usage
text = "Hello, how are you?"
filename = "output.mp3"
text_to_speech(text, filename)


"""
In this example, we define a function text_to_speech that takes in the text you want to convert and the desired filename for the audio output. It uses gTTS to generate an audio file with the specified text and language (in this case, English). The audio file is saved with the specified filename.

After saving the audio file, the code uses the os.system function to play the audio file using an external command. In this example, it assumes the mpg123 command-line tool is installed on your system to play the audio file. You may need to install mpg123 or adjust the command based on your specific setup.

Remember to install the gTTS library using pip before running this code. You can install it by running pip install gtts.
