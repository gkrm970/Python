 # code snippet that reads data from a file and converts it to audio using the gTTS library in Python:
 
from gtts import gTTS
import os

def file_to_speech(filename, output_filename):
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()

    tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')
    tts.save(output_filename)

    # Play the audio file
    os.system(f"mpg123 {output_filename}")  # You may need to install mpg123 or change the command based on your system

# Example usage
input_filename = 'input.txt'
output_filename = 'output.mp3'
file_to_speech(input_filename, output_filename)


"""
In this example, we define a function file_to_speech that takes in the input filename (the file containing the text you want to convert) and the desired output filename for the audio file.

The code reads the contents of the input file using open() and read(). It then uses the gTTS library to generate an audio file with the text read from the input file and the specified language (in this case, English). The audio file is saved with the specified output filename.

After saving the audio file, the code uses the os.system function to play the audio file using an external command. As mentioned before, it assumes the mpg123 command-line tool is installed on your system to play the audio file. You may need to install mpg123 or adjust the command based on your specific setup.

Make sure to adjust the input_filename and output_filename variables to the appropriate file paths for your use case.
