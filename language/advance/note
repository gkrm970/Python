Why and When to Use Lambda Functions?
Lambda vs. Regular Functions
Key Takeaways


The Python lambda functions are similar to user-defined functions but are anonymous with No name.
It is typically a small and restricted function that can’t have more than one line. 

every anonymous function defined in the Python programming language will have three essential parts- 
the lambda keyword, the parameters, and the function body.

Python Lambda Function Syntax
==================================
Lambda argument (s): expression

Using Lambda with Python Built-ins.
----------------------------
lambdas are callable as soon as they are defined and passed as an argument to Python’s built-in functions


Lambda Function with other function
----------------------------------
Filter()-->
A filter function in Python will require another function containing the expression or operation that is to be performed on the iterator.

filter(function, sequence)

Parameters:
function: function that tests if each element of a sequence true or not.
sequence: sequence which needs to be filtered, it can be sets, lists, tuples, or containers of any iterators.

Lambda Function with Map()
----------------------------
The map() function is used for applying a particular operation to each value in a sequence so that they can be modified. 
map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.) Syntax :

map(fun, iter)

Lambda Function with Reduce()
-----------------------------
Similarly to the map() function, the reduce() function is also used for applying a particular operation to each value in a sequence so that they can be modified. However, the working of reduce function is quite different from the map function. This particular built-in function of Python performs a repetitive operation over the pairs given in the sequence.

function is used to apply a particular function passed in its argument to all of the list elements mentioned in the sequence passed along.This function is defined in “functools” module.

The reduce(fun,seq)

why lambda
---------------
Lambdas enable a developer to provide a function as a parameter to another Python built-in function (for instance, in the map, filter, reduce, etc.).


Regular expressions.
---------------------
A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings,
using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world.

A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern. It is a powerful tool for
matching patterns in text and is used in various applications, including text processing, programming, and data validation.

?: Matches zero or one occurrences of the preceding character or group
*: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group
+: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group
{m,n}: Matches from m to n occurrences of the preceding character or group, inclusive
{m,}: Matches at least m occurrences of the preceding character or group
{,n}: Matches up to n occurrences of the preceding character or group


Applications of Regular Expressions:

Text Editing and Search: Regex is widely used in text editors and search engines to find specific patterns or words
within text. For instance, you can use regex to search for all occurrences of a particular word, extract email addresses
from a list, or validate phone numbers.

Data Validation: Regex is employed in data validation to ensure that user input conforms to specific rules or formats.
For example, you can use regex to check if an email address follows the correct format, if a password meets complexity
requirements, or if a postal code is valid.

Text Processing and Manipulation: Regex is instrumental in text processing tasks like tokenization, pattern matching,
and text normalization. It can be used to split text into individual words, identify specific patterns in text,
or remove unwanted characters or formatting.

Web Scraping and Data Extraction: Regex is a valuable tool for web scraping and data extraction from websites.
It allows you to extract specific information from HTML code, such as product details, pricing information,
or contact details.

Bioinformatics and Computational Linguistics: Regex is used in bioinformatics and computational linguistics for
analyzing sequences of nucleotides or amino acids, identifying patterns in genetic data, and extracting meaningful
information from text.

The Python module re provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python.
The re module raises the exception re.error if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression.


Regular Expression Syntax
---------------------------
A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the functions in this module let you check
if a particular string matches a given regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular string,
which comes down to the same thing).

Regular expressions can be concatenated to form new regular expressions; if A and B are both regular expressions,
then AB is also a regular expression. In general, if a string p matches A and another string q matches B, the string pq
will match AB. This holds unless A or B contain low precedence operations; boundary conditions between A and B; or have
repeated qualifiers.

The module re provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. The re module raises the exception
re.error if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression.

Regular Expression Patterns
----------------------------
A regular expression pattern is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of
strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern. Regular expressions are widely used in UNIX world.

The Python module re provides full support for Perl-like regular expressions in Python. The re module raises the
exception re.error if an error occurs while compiling or using a regular expression.

Regular Expression Examples
----------------------------

The following example illustrates the use of the re.search() function to find a substring that matches a regular
expression pattern. It uses the combination of the re.search() and re.group() functions.

The re.search() function takes the regular expression pattern and the string and returns a match object when the
pattern is found. It returns None if the pattern is not found.

The re.group() function returns the string matched by the re.search() function. It returns None if the pattern is not
found.

The following example illustrates the use of the re.match() function to find a substring that matches a regular

The re.match() function takes the regular expression pattern and the string and returns a match object when the
pattern is found. It returns None if the pattern is not found.

The re.group() function returns the string matched by the re.match() function. It returns None if the pattern is not
found.
