So far, we have seen how slicing can reverse a string. Another built-in function for doing so is the reversed(d). However, it works slightly differently. For example:


>>> reversed('shop')
>>> <reversed object at 0x7f41a310def0>
>>> for i in reversed('shop'):
...  print(i)
...
p
o
h
s


What is the output of the following code?


Note: try to solve it without using the terminal.


chars = "1234"
char = ""
for char in reversed(chars):
    char += char

print(char)

cc
4321
10
11


movie = "My    beautiful\n laundrette!"

# Create a list of the above string
# without extra spaces nor new lines
movie = movie.split()


# Use slices, concatenation and list index all in one line
# to join the elements of the list excluding the exclamation mark
movie = " ".join(movie[:-1]) + " " + movie[-1][:-1]

# Change the word laundrette to garden
movie = movie.replace('laundrette', 'garden')

# Capitalize only the first character of each word and print the new string
print(movie.title())

txt = ",$,,   chocolate   banana ice-cream..."

# Add more options in the strip()
txt = txt.strip(",$ .")

# Clear any space left and print the outcome
txt = " ".join(txt.split())
print(txt)

Open the file cipher_encrypt.py, and complete the function that encrypts a string. The string comes from user input. Make use of a simple Caesar cipher algorithm, which shifts each letter of the alphabet to the next one.


For more info about Caesar's encryption, see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher

msg = input("Enter your message to encrypt: ")


def encrypt(msg):
    result = ""

    # iterate through the input msg
    for i in range(len(msg)):
        char = msg[i]
        # Check if character is alphanumeric

            # Check char is either Z or z and append A, a respectively




            # Else shift to the next letter


        # If char not alphanumeric just continue

        return result


print("Message to encrypt : ", msg)
print("Cipher: ", encrypt(msg))



Open the file cipher_decrypt.py, and complete the program which takes as input an encrypted text from the previous exercise and decrypts it.

cipher = input('Enter your encrypted message: ')


def decrypt(cipher):
    result = ""
    # Iterate through the cipher

        # Check whether character is alphanumeric

            # Check whether character is A or a, replace with Z or z




            # Else shift letter one below
            else:

        # Else append character as it is
        else:

    return result
