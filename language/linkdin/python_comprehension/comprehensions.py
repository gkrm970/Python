# What are comprehensions?
# Comprehensions are a feature of Python which I would really miss if I ever had to leave it.
# Comprehensions are constructs that allow sequences to be built from other sequences.

# Python 2.0 introduced list comprehensions, and Python 3.0 comes with dictionary and set comprehensions.
# Python 3.5 has added comprehension for the use of generators.
