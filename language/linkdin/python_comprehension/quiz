Given the comprehension [e ** 2 for e in mylist if e > 10], the if statement part is known as a:

transform expression
output expression
predicate expression (correct)

The if statement part of a comprehension is known as a predicate expression. It is used to filter out elements that don't match the predicate.

Which of the following is not a valid comprehension?

[e for e in mylist if e > 10] (correct)
[e for e in mylist if e > 10 else 0]
[e if e > 10 else 0 for e in mylist]
[e if e > 10 for e in mylist]

The else statement is not valid in a comprehension. The if statement is valid, but only if it is placed after the for statement.
