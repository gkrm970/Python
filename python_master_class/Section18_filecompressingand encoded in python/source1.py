#Here's a simplified version of compressing and decompressing a file using the zlib library in Python:

#Compressing a file:

import zlib

def compress_file(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f_in:
        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out:
            compressed_data = zlib.compress(f_in.read())
            f_out.write(compressed_data)

input_file = 'input.txt'
output_file = 'compressed.bin'
compress_file(input_file, output_file)
print(f'{input_file} compressed and saved as {output_file}')


#Decompressing a file:

import zlib

def decompress_file(input_file, output_file):
    with open(input_file, 'rb') as f_in:
        with open(output_file, 'wb') as f_out:
            decompressed_data = zlib.decompress(f_in.read())
            f_out.write(decompressed_data)

input_file = 'compressed.bin'
output_file = 'decompressed.txt'
decompress_file(input_file, output_file)
print(f'{input_file} decompressed and saved as {output_file}')

"""
Again, remember to replace 'input.txt', 'compressed.bin', and 'decompressed.txt' with the actual file paths you want to use. The compressed file will have the .bin extension, and the decompressed file will have the .txt extension.
