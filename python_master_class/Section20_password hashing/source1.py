"""
 you can implement password hashing using various libraries, but one widely used library is bcrypt. Here's an example of how you can use bcrypt to hash and verify passwords:

First, you'll need to install the bcrypt library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:


pip install bcrypt
Once bcrypt is installed, you can use the following code to hash and verify passwords:
"""

import bcrypt

# Function to hash a password
def hash_password(password):
    # Generate a salt
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt()
    # Hash the password using the salt
    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
    # Return the hashed password as a string
    return hashed_password.decode('utf-8')

# Function to verify a password
def verify_password(password, hashed_password):
    # Verify the password against the hashed password
    return bcrypt.checkpw(password.encode('utf-8'), hashed_password.encode('utf-8'))

# Example usage
password = "my_password"

# Hash the password
hashed_password = hash_password(password)

# Verify the password
is_valid = verify_password(password, hashed_password)

if is_valid:
    print("Password is valid!")
else:
    print("Invalid password.")


"""
In the above code, the hash_password function takes a password as input, generates a salt using gensalt(), and then hashes the password using hashpw(). The resulting hashed password is returned as a string.

The verify_password function takes a password and a hashed password as inputs. It uses checkpw() to verify whether the provided password matches the hashed password. It returns True if the password is valid and False otherwise.

Remember to handle the storage of the hashed password securely, such as in a database, and retrieve it when needed for verification. This example demonstrates the basic usage of password hashing with bcrypt.
