POSTgreSQL
==========
POSTgreSQL (also written as PostgreSQL or simply Postgres).is an open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS). 
It is known for its robustness, scalability, and extensibility, making it a popular choice for handling large amounts of data in various applications.

PostgreSQL follows the SQL (Structured Query Language) standard and provides a wide range of features and capabilities. 
It supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, which ensure data integrity and reliability. 
It also offers advanced functionality such as support for complex queries, indexes, stored procedures, triggers, and full-text search.

One of the key strengths of PostgreSQL is its support for object-relational database features. 
It allows users to define custom data types, create complex data structures, and build relationships between tables using foreign keys. 
This flexibility makes it suitable for handling complex data models and diverse application requirements.

Additionally, PostgreSQL has a vibrant and active open-source community that continually contributes to its development. 
This community-driven approach has resulted in frequent updates, bug fixes, and the introduction of new features. 
It is available for multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and various Unix-like systems.

PostgreSQL is widely used by organizations and developers for various applications, ranging from small-scale projects to enterprise-level systems. 
It is particularly popular in sectors such as finance, telecommunications, scientific research, and geospatial applications, where data integrity and reliability are crucial.

Overall, PostgreSQL is a powerful and feature-rich database management system that provides a robust foundation for managing and manipulating data in a wide range of applications.
