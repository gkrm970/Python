mkdir - Creates a new directory
copy - Copies one or more files from one location to another
del - Deletes one or more files
type - Displays the contents of a text file
move - Moves one or more files from one location to another
cls - Clears the command prompt window


the basic commands in Windows command prompt and Linux are quite similar, but there are some differences in the syntax and usage. 
For example, in Windows, you use the "copy" command to copy files, while in Linux, you use "cp". 
Similarly, in Windows, you use "del" to delete files, while in Linux, you use "rm". 
The commands for navigating the file system (cd and ls) are the same in both Windows and Linux.


du -sh . --> define the size of the directory 

ls -ltr

rm -rf file_name
grep -ir text_start *


cp -aprf filename

pip3 install pipenv
pipenv shell
pipfile


ls ../file_name
