Web Development:

Flask or Django or FastAPI_POC: Get started with web development using Python by learning either Flask (lightweight) or Django (full-featured) web frameworks.

Database Integration: Understand how to connect Python applications to databases like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
"""
"""When it comes to web development using Python, Flask, Django, and FastAPI_POC are popular frameworks with their own 
strengths and use cases. Here's an overview of each framework: 

Flask:
Flask is a lightweight web framework that provides flexibility and simplicity. It is a good choice for smaller 
projects or when you want more control over the development process. It does not come with built-in features like 
database integration or authentication. Instead, Flask allows you to choose the libraries and tools that best fit 
your needs. Flask has a smaller learning curve compared to Django, making it easier to get started for beginners. 
Flask is known for its extensive documentation, active community support, and wide range of available extensions. 

Django: Django is a full-featured web framework that follows the "batteries included" philosophy. It provides a 
complete set of tools and features for web development, including database integration, authentication, 
and administration. Django has a robust ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that simplifies database integration and 
supports multiple database backends, including SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. It includes an administration interface 
that allows you to manage your application's data easily. Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
architectural pattern and enforces certain conventions, making it suitable for larger and complex projects. Django 
has a large and active community, extensive documentation, and numerous reusable packages available (Django 

packages). FastAPI_POC: FastAPI_POC is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ type 
hints. It offers excellent performance due to its use of asynchronous programming and the Starlette framework. 
FastAPI_POC is well-suited for developing APIs quickly and efficiently, making it a popular choice for microservices and 
backend systems. Similar to Flask, FastAPI_POC does not come with built-in support for database integration or other 
features commonly found in full-stack frameworks like Django. FastAPI_POC integrates well with popular databases such as 
SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL using third-party libraries. Database Integration: All three frameworks (Flask, Django, 
and FastAPI_POC) provide ways to connect Python applications to databases: 

SQLite: All three frameworks have built-in support for SQLite, which is a lightweight, file-based database. You can 
use SQLite as a development database or for small-scale applications. 

MySQL and PostgreSQL: Flask, Django, and FastAPI_POC support MySQL and PostgreSQL databases through their respective 
database connectors. For Flask and FastAPI_POC, you can use libraries like SQLAlchemy or the built-in database API 
libraries for database integration. Django has its own ORM that supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and other 
database systems. 

To get started with database integration in any of these frameworks, you will typically need to install the required 
database connectors or ORM libraries, configure the database connection settings, and then interact with the database 
using the provided APIs or ORM. 

Overall, the choice between Flask, Django, or FastAPI_POC depends on your project's requirements, complexity, 
and your familiarity with the frameworks. Flask offers simplicity and flexibility, Django provides a full-featured 
framework for larger projects, and FastAPI_POC excels in building high-performance APIs.
