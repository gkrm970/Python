--------------
Python -> Structured + object oriented programming language

oops ( Object oriented Programming concepts)
-----------------------------------------------
class
object
Inheritance
Polymorphism


class  object
Employee ----> John, scott, marry etc....
Animal   ------> Dog, Horse, Elephant   etc....


class ---> collection of variables(attributes) & methods(behavior)
			-A class is blue print
			-Logical entity
			-Does not occupy space in the memory

object  ---> object is an instance of class
Physical entity
Occupy certain amount space in the memory

For one class, we can create multiple objects. and Objects are independents.......

Function Vs Method
----------------------
Function --> we can create without class or outside the class called function.
Method --> the function creates in side the class  called method.

2 types of methods we can define within the class....

1) instance method ( we call only through object)
2) static method ( we can directly call using class)
       when we call the static method inside the class , we have to give value for self parameter
       annotation ---->@staticmethod,


Global variables
Class variables --> declare the variable inside the class is called class variable.
Local variables

Method  & constructor
-------------------------
Method: give any name
		 return the value/s
		 method can take arguments/parameters
		 we have to use an object to invoke the method

Constructor:constructor name is fixed :
			   def  __init__(self):
	
 constructor will not return any value but print the value.
 constructor can also take arguments/parameters
 constructor will be called at the time of object creation itself.
 as soon as created the object, constructor called automatically
 No mandatory to create the initialization constructor in the class.
