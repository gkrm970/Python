Key Takeaways


The Python lambda functions are similar to user-defined functions but are anonymous with No name.
It is typically a small and restricted function that can’t have more than one line. 

every anonymous function defined in the Python programming language will have three essential parts- 
the lambda keyword, the parameters, and the function body.

Python Lambda Function Syntax
==================================
Lambda argument (s): expression

Using Lambda with Python Built-ins.
----------------------------
lambdas are callable as soon as they are defined and passed as an argument to Python’s built-in functions


Lambda Function with other function
----------------------------------
Filter()-->
A filter function in Python will require another function containing the expression or operation that is to be performed on the iterator.

filter(function, sequence)

Parameters:
function: function that tests if each element of a sequence true or not.
sequence: sequence which needs to be filtered, it can be sets, lists, tuples, or containers of any iterators.

Lambda Function with Map()
----------------------------
The map() function is used for applying a particular operation to each value in a sequence so that they can be modified. 
map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.) Syntax :

map(fun, iter)

Lambda Function with Reduce()
-----------------------------
Similarly to the map() function, the reduce() function is also used for applying a particular operation to each value in a sequence so that they can be modified. However, the working of reduce function is quite different from the map function. This particular built-in function of Python performs a repetitive operation over the pairs given in the sequence.

function is used to apply a particular function passed in its argument to all of the list elements mentioned in the sequence passed along.This function is defined in “functools” module.

The reduce(fun,seq)

why lambda
---------------
Lambdas enable a developer to provide a function as a parameter to another Python built-in function (for instance, in the map, filter, reduce, etc.).
